The stock was recently at $6.82, compared with Thursday's close of $3.35. Volume was more than 100 million shares, compared with a 65-day average of 3.5 million. Shares rose 30% Wednesday and 3% Thursday. GeoVax said Thursday that it will present at the Emerging Growth Conference next week. It plans to discuss recent mpox developments and milestones related to a Covid-19 vaccine award from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. The company's lead clinical program is the Covid vaccine GEO-CM04S1. In December, GeoVax said it amended a Covid-related license agreement with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, expanding its commercial license to include mpox and smallpox as additional indications. On Thursday, Sweden became the first country outside Africa to confirm mpox clade Ib in a person with travel history to central Africa, according to the WHO. Meanwhile, Emergent Biosolutions shares were recently up 24% to $10.73. Emergent, maker of smallpox vaccine ACAM2000, is seeking Food and Drug Administration approval to expand the indication to include immunization against mpox virus.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has also issued a new risk assessment, warning that the European Union/European Economic Area is likely to see more imported cases of mpox caused by the clade I virus currently circulating in Africa. Although the risk of sustained transmission within Europe is considered low, the possibility of more cases being brought into Europe has prompted the ECDC to recommend heightened preparedness and rapid response measures. Recommendations: The ECDC advises EU/EEA member states to issue travel advice for individuals visiting or returning from regions affected by the outbreak. The ECDC also stresses the need for robust surveillance, laboratory testing and epidemiological investigations to swiftly detect and respond to any mpox cases that might arise. The situation in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has become increasingly concerning, with a significant rise in mpox cases and the emergence of a new clade I variant. The outbreak in Africa is distinct from the global MPXV clade IIb outbreak of 2022, which continues to circulate at low levels worldwide. The new variant has already spread to several neighboring countries, further raising alarms about its potential impact on global health. GOVX Price Action: GeoVax shares were up by 65.4% at $5.56 according to Benzinga Pro. www.benzinga.com/pro See Also: Image via Unsplash. \u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

A new variant has spread rapidly in Africa, prompting the World Health Organization to declare mpox a global public health emergency on Wednesday. Europe's disease prevention agency said on Friday more imported cases will appear in the region, a day after Sweden reported its first case of mpox linked to the new strain. Shares of Danish biotech firm Bavarian Nordic\nBAVA\n, which makes an mpox vaccine, jumped 20% on Friday. They have climbed 50% this week as concerns over the virus rise. Shares in Emergent BioSolutions\nEBS\ngained 15% in U.S. trading. Its vaccine, approved for smallpox, has also been used as an mpox shot, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is yet to approve its application for use against the virus. Jefferies analysts said in a note on Thursday they expect significant orders for Bavarian Nordic's mpox vaccine due to the outbreak. Up to roughly 3 million doses of the vaccine could potentially be made available in 2024 and 10 million in 2025, the Jefferies analysts said. Winning approval for administering to adolescents and children would be key, they said. Shares in other companies involved in the mpox response have also swung wildly this week. SIGA Technologies\nSIGA\njumped 7% on Friday, after falling nearly 20% a day earlier after its mpox drug failed to meet the main goal in a study. U.S.-listed Geovax Labs,\nGOVX\n, which had a market capitalization of less than $20 million as of Thursday, surged 60% to $5.35 in early trading. The company is developing a vaccine against mpox and smallpox. Bavarian Nordic's shares closed up 17.8% at 282.5 Danish crowns."
