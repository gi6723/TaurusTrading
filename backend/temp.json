                        "Article Text": "By Josh Beckerman GeoVax Labs shares more than doubled Friday, adding to gains that took place after the World Health Organization's Wednesday declaration of mpox as a public health emergency of international concern. The stock was recently at $6.82, compared with Thursday's close of $3.35. Volume was more than 100 million shares, compared with a 65-day average of 3.5 million. Shares rose 30% Wednesday and 3% Thursday. GeoVax said Thursday that it will present at the Emerging Growth Conference next week. It plans to discuss recent mpox developments and milestones related to a Covid-19 vaccine award from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. The company's lead clinical program is the Covid vaccine GEO-CM04S1. In December, GeoVax said it amended a Covid-related license agreement with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, expanding its commercial license to include mpox and smallpox as additional indications. On Thursday, Sweden became the first country outside Africa to confirm mpox clade Ib in a person with travel history to central Africa, according to the WHO. Meanwhile, Emergent Biosolutions shares were recently up 24% to $10.73. Emergent, maker of smallpox vaccine ACAM2000, is seeking Food and Drug Administration approval to expand the indication to include immunization against mpox virus.
